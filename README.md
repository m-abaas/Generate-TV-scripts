# Generate-TV-scripts

## Introduction
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior for a time sequence. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs.

## Project goal
In this project, RNN concept is used to generate new Simpsons TV scripts based on old dataset from previous seasons, the notebook in this repositery has all the steps of building, training and examining the network on a step by step basis.
